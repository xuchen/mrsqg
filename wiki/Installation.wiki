MrsQG is written in Java  -- compilation and installation are easy. But it calls PET (C++) to do parsing and LOGON/LKB (LISP) to do generation, thus users need to install these two first.

==Compile PET==

PET can be obtained from [http://wiki.delph-in.net/moin/PetTop PetTop]. Compiling PET from sources is needed.

MrsQG runs PET in server mode. A unique signal is needed after PET has output the parsing results. Thus after obtaining the source code of PET, users need to modify the file cheap/cheap.cpp:

Locate to the end of the function interactive() and add the following line before fflush(fstatus);:

 fprintf(fstatus, "cheap is brutally patched\n");

 so the overall area looks like this:

    fprintf(fstatus, "cheap is brutally patched\n");
    fflush(fstatus);

    if(Chart != 0) delete Chart;

    id++;
  } /* while */

Then follow the normal procedure to install PET. 

==Install LOGON/LKB==

LOGON is able to give ranked output with an MaxEnt model so it is recommended over LKB. 

To install LOGON, follow [http://wiki.delph-in.net/moin/LogonInstallation LogonInstallation].

To install LKB, follow [http://wiki.delph-in.net/moin/LkbInstallation LkbInstallation]. The 'test' version rather than 'stable' or 'latest' version is required.
